and suggests a daily workout duration and basic diet plan.

## How to Run
1. Run the Python file `workout_planner.py`
2. Enter weight in kilograms
3. Enter height in centimeters
4. The program displays BMI and workout recommendations

## BMI Categories
- Underweight: BMI < 18.5 → 20 minutes workout
- Normal weight: 18.5 ≤ BMI < 25 → 30 minutes workout
- Overweight: BMI ≥ 25 → 45 minutes workout

## Unit Testing
Unit tests are written using PyTest to verify BMI calculation and workout recommendations.

## Version 2.0 Update
The application now also recommends where the user should work out based on BMI:
- Underweight: Home workouts
- Normal weight: Home or Gym
- Overweight: Gym workouts
